 * Marks this package as the root of a Bounded Context.

 * Bounded Context is a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design. DDD deals with
 * large models by dividing them into different Bounded Contexts and being
 * explicit about their interrelationships.
 * 
 * If you don't understand this well enough, please ask for explanation because
 * it's at the same time delicate to understand but also very important.
